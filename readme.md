## How to use it?

To use it, you have to create a text file without space in the name. In that text file, write the movie's title and year that you want to search.

![ScreenShot](screenshot\movies_name.png)

Open the cmd in this folder and type the command below.

```
F:\....\search movie>py main.py file_name_that_you_created.txt
```

(In my case, I created `test_input.txt`)

Then hit Enter.

After the done message, you will found a new file in the directory called `search_result.txt`.

In that file, you will get the movie's search results with download links if that's already available on our server.

That's it, thank you. :P
